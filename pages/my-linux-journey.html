        <h1>My Linux Journey</h1>
        <p class="date">22, 07, 2024</p>
        <h2 class="mt">The Leap</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine being stuck in a digital maze, endlessly alt-tabbing through a
          clutter of windows, each keystroke a reminder of the inefficiencies of
          your current system. This was my reality on Windows, until a moment of
          serendipity changed everything. A video about ThePrimeagen's seamless
          workflow on Linux sparked a curiosity that led me down a rabbit hole
          of discovery and transformation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">Why Linux</h2>
        <p>
          In early 2022, I experienced many problems with Windows 10, and
          upgrading to Windows 11 was not an option because it didn't support my
          hardware. One day, I stumbled upon a video about
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdumjiHabhQ"
            class="text-blue"
            >ThePrimeagen's developer workflow</a
          >. I was quickly amazed by how he could jump around his windows like a
          kangaroo while I was stuck alt-tabbing everywhere like a clueless,
          lost child. After finishing that video, I knew that I had to switch to
          Linux.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">The Start Of A New Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I started my Linux journey with <b>Ubuntu 22.04</b>, and it was pretty
          good. Everything worked fine out of the box, I had no problems with
          the software I use every day, everything was all sunshine and
          rainbows. After a couple of days with Ubuntu, I decided to try to
          "rice" Gnome. I followed a tutorial and learned about tools like
          <b>Gnome-Tweaks</b> and <b>Extension Manager</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          I tried to configure my Gnome workflow to be similar to ThePrimeagen's
          workflow, and although it was not as good as ThePrimeagen's workflow,
          it was still better than Windows.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">The Tiling Window Manager Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>
          After installing i3wm, I didn't know how to use it. So I did what a
          normal human would do and searched for a tutorial on YouTube. I
          clicked on this
          <a
            class="text-blue"
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIFlZlDZc&t=1665s"
            >video</a
          >
          by
          <a class="text-blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/@oglothenerd"
            >OgloTheNerd</a
          >
          about ricing i3wm, and it taught me about configuring i3wm and
          Polybar.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          After the video, I decided to mess around in i3 and managed to make
          something quite usable. I decided to copy my workflow from
          ThePrimeagen, and after a week in i3, I could never switch back to a
          Desktop Environment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">Current State Of The Journey</h2>
        <p>
          It has been about 2 years since I started this journey of going from
          Windows to Linux, and I'm glad that I made the switch. I got really
          familiar with the terminal and useful CLI tools like jq, which are
          really game-changing.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          In these 2 years of using Linux, I've learned a lot about my system,
          I've switched between many distros, and I'm currently using Arch. I've
          also tried almost all of the popular tiling window managers and
          desktop environments. My workflow has become more ergonomic and is
          blazingly fast thanks to Linux.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          I still have a long way to go. I'm currently developing my own tiling
          window manager. Linux is a lifelong journey and not just a skill you
          can master in 1 or 2 years.
