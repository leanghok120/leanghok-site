        <h1>My Linux Journey</h1>
        <p class="date">22, 07, 2024</p>
        <h2 class="mt">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This blog will talk about my journey of moving from Windows to linux
          and how it affected my workflow.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          I will also share useful resources at the end for beginners who want
          to make the switch from windows to linux.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">Why Linux</h2>
        <p>
          In early 2022, I experienced tons of problems with Windows 10 and
          upgrading to Windows 11 was not a choice because it didn't support my
          hardware. One day, I stumbled upon a video about
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdumjiHabhQ"
            class="text-blue"
            >ThePrimeagen's developer workflow</a
          >, I was quickly amazed how he could jump around his windows like a
          kangaroo meanwhile I'm stucked alt tabbing everywhere like a clueless
          lost child. After finishing that video, I knew that I had to switch to
          linux.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">The Start Of A New Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I started my linux journey with <b>Ubuntu 22.04</b> and it was pretty
          good, everything worked fine out of the box, I had no problems with
          the softwares I use everyday, everything was all sunshine and rainbow.
          After a couple of days with Ubuntu, I decided to try to "rice" Gnome.
          I followed a tutorial and I learned about tools like
          <b>Gnome-Tweaks</b> and <b>Extension Manager</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          I tried to configure my Gnome workflow to be similar to ThePrimeagen's
          workflow and although it was not as good as ThePrimeagen's workflow,
          it was still better than Windows
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">The Tiling Window Manager Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>
          After installing i3wm, I didn't know how to use it. So I did what a
          normal human would do and searched for a tutorial on Youtube. I click
          on this
          <a
            class="text-blue"
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIFlZlDZc&t=1665s"
            >video</a
          >
          by
          <a class="text-blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/@oglothenerd"
            >OgloTheNerd</a
          >
          about ricing i3wm and it taught me about configuring i3wm and polybar.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          After the video, I decided to mess around in i3 and managed to make
          something quite usable. I decided to copy my workflow from
          ThePrimeagen and after a week in i3, I could never switch back to a
          Desktop Environment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt">Current State Of The Journey</h2>
        <p>
          It has been about 2 years since I started this journey of going from
          Windows to Linux and I'm glad that I made the switch. I got really
          familiar with the terminal and useful CLI tools like jq which are
          really game-changing.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          In this 2 years of linux, I've learned alot about my system, I've
          switched between tons of distros and I'm using Arch currently. I've
          also tried almost all of the popular tiling windows manager and
          desktop environment. My workflow has become more ergonomic and is
          blazingly fast thanks to linux.
        </p>

        <p class="mt">
          I still have a long way to go, I'm currently developing my own tiling
          windows manager. Linux is a lifelong journey and not just a skill you
          can master in 1 or 2 years.
