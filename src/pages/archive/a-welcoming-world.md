Imagine a world where everyone is just a little bit kinder, a little bit more welcoming. How much of a difference would that actually make?

I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUaZ9Vr-Cg) on youtube a couple of days ago talking about the differences between disney and ghibli movies. That video has been stuck
in my mind until now and I just wanna write about it here.
