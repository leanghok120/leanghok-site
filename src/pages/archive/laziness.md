Lately, I've just been scrolling and not doing anything at all. I have stuff I need to do like my history group presentation that I haven't
gotten started on yet. And as much as I want to finish the script for the presentation, I just can't get myself to do it.

I also haven't been coding for these couple of days. I wonder if this is another case of burn out anyways back to watching spy x family
