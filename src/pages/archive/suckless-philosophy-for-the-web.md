## Modern web dev

Moden web development has become too complicated. There's tons of
libraries and frameworks available out there for the simplest of
tasks that can be done within a few lines of code.

## Suckless

If you're in the linux community, you probably know about [suckless](https://suckless.org)
and their [philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy).

I think if we're able to bring the suckless philosophy to
the web, it would be so much easier and simpler to build stuff you
actually want to build.
