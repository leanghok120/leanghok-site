title: "Trying Badminton"

A couple of days ago, I found out that there was a badminton gym near my house. I've never touched a badminton racket before
but I wanted to try something new once. So I called one of my friends who played badminton to teach me how to play. Turns out,
badminton is actually pretty fun. I like badminton more than volleyball because there's no volleyball court near me and none of my
friends play volleyball meanwhile almost all of my friends play badminton so I actually have some people to play with.
