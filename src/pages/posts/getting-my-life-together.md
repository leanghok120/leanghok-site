> I seriously need to get my life together, man

# The Problem

So, here’s the thing: I’m only 13, and for most of my life, I’ve just kept everything — tasks, ideas, random thoughts in my
head. No notebooks, no fancy apps, just... vibes. And honestly, it worked well enough for 10 years.
Somehow, I managed to juggle everything without really _organizing_ anything.

But lately? My life’s gotten pretty messy. Things are slipping through the cracks,
and I’m dropping the ball on projects, deadlines, homework, and personal stuff.
It feels like I’m always behind, and it’s all because I’ve never tracked anything properly.
Now with exams, projects, assignments, coding, and all the usual life stuff piling up, it’s starting to get overwhelming.

## Why The Change?

I guess as I’ve gotten older (and more stuff has piled on), I realized that the “wing it” method doesn't work anymore,
especially when it's not just kindergarten and gaming now; There's real pressure. I need something better than relying
on my already deep-fried brain to remember everything.

## Trying Notion

So, here I am, trying to get organized. I recently started using Notion to help sort out all the chaos.
It’s early days, but I’m hoping it’ll help me stay on top of things and maybe bring some structure into
this chaos I’ve been living in.

But yeah, that’s where I’m at. Let’s hope that Notion will help me get my life together.
