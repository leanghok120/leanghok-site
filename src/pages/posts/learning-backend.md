## The Frontend

A couple of months ago, I decided to dive back into frontend web development. I started with the
basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With just those simple tools, I was able to create a
clean, static website. It felt amazing to see something I built come to life on the screen!

Once I got comfortable, I switched from vanilla CSS to Tailwind CSS, it made a significant impact on my projects!
Tailwind streamlined my workflow, and it took me just one day to get the hang of it. After that, I started
learning React. I focused on basic concepts like components and hooks, including useState and useEffect.
Before long, I could build simple apps like weather apps and todo lists.

But even though I could create functional and visually appealing frontends, I felt like something was missing.
I wanted to take my projects further.

## Messing with Backend Development

At this point, I knew I could build decent frontend apps, but I craved more. I wanted to create
full-fledged web applications, and that meant learning backend development.

I started learning Node.js, following [W3Schools' guide](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp).
I managed to build a simple web server, which gave me a lot of confidence. Node.js' built-in modules like
http, url, and fs were fairly straightforward and helped me get a solid grasp of server-side development. That
foundation made it easier for me to transition into using Express.js.

After getting comfortable with Express, I started learning about databases. Choosing the right
database to learn was a bit of a challenge, but I eventually settled on MySQL. I learned basic SQL queries and CRUD
operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and integrated MySQL with Express to build a simple REST API.

And then came the big moment â€” I built my **first-ever fullstack app**: a library app.
It allowed users to add and delete books, all from a clean, user-friendly interface. Seeing it all come
together, from the frontend interactions to the backend logic, felt like a huge milestone in my journey
of learning Fullstack Development.

## What's Next?

I still have a lot more to learn about backend development like User Authentication and Authorization but this has been
a really fun journey and I'm so excited to learn more about this.
