# Overview

This blog will talk about my journey of moving from Windows to linux and how it affected my workflow.

I will also share useful resources at the end for beginners who want to make the switch from windows to linux.

## Why Linux

In early 2022, I experienced tons of problems with Windows 10 and upgrading to Windows 11 was not a choice because it didn't support my hardware. One day, I stumbled upon a video about [ThePrimeagen's developer workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdumjiHabhQ), I was quickly amazed how he could jump around his windows like a kangaroo meanwhile I'm stucked alt tabbing everywhere like a clueless lost child. After finishing that video, I knew that I had to switch to linux.

## The Start Of A New Journey

I started my linux journey with **Ubuntu 22.04** and it was pretty good, everything worked fine out of the box, I had no problems with the softwares I use everyday, everything was all _sunshine and rainbow_. After a couple of days with Ubuntu, I decided to try to "rice" Gnome. I followed a tutorial and I learned about tools like **Gnome-Tweaks** and **Extension Manager**.

I tried to configure my Gnome workflow to be similar to ThePrimeagen's workflow and although it was not as good as ThePrimeagen's workflow, it was still better than Windows

## The First Month

The first month with Linux went surprisingly well. I learned about the fundamentals of Linux like the filesystem, and basic commands. It was also at this period of time where I found out about Desktop Environments and Window Managers. Initially, I got very confused about them but after watching [Distrotube's Guide to tiling windows manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obzf9ppODJU&t=38s&pp=ygUhZGlzdHJvdHViZSB0aWxpbmcgd2luZG93IG1hbmFnZXJz), I understood what a WM is and what a DE is.

After being comfortable with Gnome, I decided to try out I3wm because [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) uses it.

## The Tiling Window Manager Rabbit Hole

After installing i3wm, I didn't know how to use it. So I did what a normal human would do and searched for a tutorial on Youtube. I click on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIFlZlDZc&t=1665s) by [OgloTheNerd](https://www.youtube.com/@oglothenerd) about ricing i3wm and it taught me about configuring i3wm and polybar.

After the video, I decided to mess around in i3 and managed to make something quite _usable_. I decided to copy my workflow from ThePrimeagen and after a week in i3, I could never switch back to a Desktop Environment.

## Current State Of The Journey

It has been about 2 years since I started this journey of going from Windows to Linux and I'm glad that I made the switch. I got really familiar with the terminal and useful CLI tools like jq which are really game-changing.

In this 2 years of linux, I've learned alot about my system, I've switched between tons of distros and I'm using **Arch** currently. I've also tried almost all of the popular tiling windows manager and desktop environment. My workflow has become more ergonomic and is blazingly fast thanks to linux.

I still have a _long_ way to go, I'm currently developing [my own tiling windows manager](https://github.com/leanghok120/moody). Linux is a lifelong journey and not just a skill you can master in 1 or 2 years.
